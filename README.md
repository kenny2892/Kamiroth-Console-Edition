# Kamiroth-Console-Edition
This is my Console Edition of Kamiroth.

What first started as a normal class assignment spiraled out of control and turned into this. The original premise was to make a simple game where the user chose a hero class and killed a monster, but I went a lot farther than that. I created Kamiroth (though I only picked that name when making the GUI version), which I filled to the brim with as many features as I could.

Things like:
  - A classic Pokemon style battle between the player and a randomly selected monster.
  - 5 Main Hero Classes.
  - 5 Joke / Easter Egg Classes.
  - 6 Monster types.
  - A Story Mode that would take the player and their team through 2 mini-bosses, 2 random events, and 1 big boss fight.
  - Settings to control whether the Jokes & Easter Eggs were active and whether or not Story Mode was to be in Hardcore Mode.
  - Teams that could be pre-determined or hand picked by the player.
  - 3 Joke Final Bosses.
  - Items that can be used in the middle of battle to boost your stats.
  - Save Functionality.
  - And More.

Here are the [Easter Eggs Listed](https://github.com/kenny2892/Kamiroth-Console-Edition/blob/master/Easter%20Eggs.md)
